    ///    `next_back()`, the **largest** stamp, so after a pop at `s₁` every
    ///    remaining entry has stamp `≤ s₁`.
    /// 2. **Stamps are globally unique within a graph** — one monotone
    ///    counter, `next_stamp`, applied once per label in `add`. A forward
    ///    revisit is keyed by the stamp of the *receive*; a backward one by
    ///    the stamp of the just-added *send*. So the two keys are never equal
    ///    and a backward pop following a skipped forward pop is at a strictly
    ///    smaller stamp `s₂ < s₁`.
    /// 3. **Lossy sends are out of scope (§9)**, so `lossy_budget == 0` and a
    ///    gated forward revisit is always at a `RecvMsg` — the `SendMsg` arm
    ///    of `forward_revisit` is reachable only through the lossy path.
    ///    After `cut_to_stamp(s₁)` that receive is the last label of its
    ///    thread, and a `RecvMsg` is the source of no rf, `TCreate` or `TEnd`
    ///    edge, so it has **no outgoing porf edge at all**.
    /// 4. `revisit_view` is `view_from_stamp(stamp(rev.pos)) ∪ porf(send) ∪
    ///    {Begin}`. The first component excludes the mutated event by (2),
    ///    the second by (3), the third adds only index-0 labels. **So a
    ///    skipped forward revisit's in-place mutation can never be copied
    ///    into a later backward revisit's view.**
    /// 5. A skipped *backward* revisit is undone exactly: `push_state` takes
    ///    `current` wholesale, leaving `current.rqueue` empty, so the
    ///    `continue` below falls into `try_pop_state` and restores graph and
    ///    queue together.
    ///
    /// **Premise (3) is the fragile one.** If §9 ever admits lossy sends, the
    /// mutated event can be a `SendMsg`, which *does* have an outgoing rf
